\item parameters
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item general\+: {\ttfamily size na, nb=\mbox{[}6,15\mbox{]},k=\mbox{[}1,3\mbox{]}}
\item more frequent\+: {\ttfamily size na, nb=\mbox{[}7,12\mbox{]},k=\mbox{[}1,2\mbox{]}}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item set-\/up
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item sysmetric code A and B, where B is obtained by flip X and Z in code A
\item identical code A and B
\item random code A and B
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item what is calculated in each test?
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item generate code A B with a filter of distance $>$ 1
\item subsystem product code
\item higher-\/dimensional hypergraph product code from the product of these two \mbox{\hyperlink{class_c_s_s}{C\+SS}} codes.
\item both left (X) and right (Z) are calculated for all those codes.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item a million tests have been running for each set-\/up
\item estimeted total running time\+: {\ttfamily 256 cores x 7 x 24 hours = 43008 cpu hours}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item dozens of cases has been found with the set-\/up of symmetric code A B or identical code A B
\item no cases has been found with random code A and B
\item observations
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item symmetry plays a role here, which tends to give smaller distance. This is consistent with the numericas of homological product code in (Bravyi \& Hastings 2013)

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item each test has a unique {\ttfamily trial number}, the log files is in this folder, and the matrices are saved in {\ttfamily Matrix\+Market} format in {\ttfamily /matrices}
\item the shell script to generate those file is {\ttfamily ../check\+\_\+random\+\_\+concatenation.sh}
